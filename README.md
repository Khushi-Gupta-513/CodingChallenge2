Bill Splitter App

# Project Overview
The Bill Splitter App** is designed to simplify the process of splitting a bill among diners. It helps calculate each person's share of the bill, including tips, according to local tipping customs. The app will automatically apply the correct tip percentage based on the total bill amount.

# Tipping Rules:
- For bills between $50 and $300, a 15% tip is added.
- For bills outside this range, a 20% tip is applied.

# Features:
- Automated Tip Calculation**: The app determines the appropriate tip percentage based on the total bill.
- Custom Bill Splitting**: Easily divide the total amount (including the tip) by the number of diners.
- User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for fast, hassle-free calculations.

# How to Use:
1. Enter the total bill amount.
2. Input the number of people sharing the bill.
3. The app will display the total amount each person needs to pay, including their share of the tip.
